Project Description
Flying Chess is a board game that originated in China and is similar to the popular game of Ludo. The objective of the game is to be the first player to move all four of their game pieces from the starting point to the finishing point, following a circular path around the board.

Each player rolls a dice on their turn and moves their game pieces according to the number of spaces indicated on the dice. The game pieces can only move in a clockwise direction and must follow the designated path around the board.

Players can capture opponents' game pieces by landing on the same space as an opponent's game piece, which then sends the captured game piece back to the starting point. However, players cannot capture game pieces of their own color.

The game features several special spaces, including safe spaces, which allow players to avoid being captured, and shortcut spaces, which allow players to skip ahead several spaces.

The game can be played with two to four players, and the first player to move all four of their game pieces to the finishing point wins the game.
